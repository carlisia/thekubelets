# TODOs
# 1) Upload mp3 file to omnystudio
# 2) No episode number in the title; add ep number to the "Episode number" field
# 3) Keep it private, but set the date to publish (always on a Mon at 8:30AM)
# 4) Add episode to playlist; save
# 5) Fetch episode slug from Advanced settings > slug (note: it can be changed but never after the publish date)
# 6) Paste the slug into episode_id below
# 7) Commit and open a PR to get the remainder of the checklist
