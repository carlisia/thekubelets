title: The Network
description: 
notes: There are two words that get the blame more often than not when a problem cannot be rooted, the network! Today, along with special guest, Scott Lowe, we try to dig into what the network actually means. We discover, through our discussion that the network is, in fact, a distributed system. This means that each component of the network has a degree of independence and the complexity of them makes it difficult to understand the true state of the network. We also look at some of the fascinating parallels between networks and other systems, such as the configuration patterns for distributed systems. A large portion of the show deals with infrastructure and networks, but we also look at how developers understand networks. In a changing space, despite self-service becoming more common, there is still generally a poor understanding of networks from the developers’ vantage point. We also cover other network-related topics, such as the future of the network engineer’s role, transferability of their skills and other similarities between network problem-solving and development problem-solving. Tune in today!
