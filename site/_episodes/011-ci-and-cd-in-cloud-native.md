title: CI and CD in Cloud Native 
description: 
notes: A warm welcome to John Harris who will be joining us for his first time on the show today to discuss our exciting topic, CI and CD in cloud native! CI and CD are two terms that usually get spoken about together but are actually two different things entirely if you think about them. We begin by getting into exactly what these differences are, highlighting the regulatory aspects of CD in contrast to the future-focussed nature of CI. We then move on to a deep exploration of their benefits in optimizing processes in cloud native space through automation and surveillance from development to production environments. You’ll hear about the benefits of automatic building in container orchestration, the value of make files and local test commands, and the evolution of CI from its ‘rubber chicken’ days with Martin Fowler and Jez Humble. We take a deep dive into the many ways that containers differ from regular binary as far as deployment methods, build speed, automation, run targets, realtime reflections of changes, and regulation. Moreover, we talk to the challenges of transitioning between testing and production environments, getting past human error through automation, and using sealed secrets to manage clusters. We also discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different CI tools such as Kubebuilder, Argo, Jenkins X, and Tekton. Our conversation gets wrapped up by looking at some of the exciting developments on the horizon of CI and CD, so make sure to tune in!
