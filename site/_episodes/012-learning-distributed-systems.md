title: Learning Distributed Systems
description: 
notes: In this episode of The Podlets Podcast, we welcome Michael Gasch from VMware to join our discussion on the necessity (or not) of formal education in working in the realm of distributed systems. There is a common belief that studying computer science is a must if you want to enter this field, but today we talk about the various ways in which individuals can teach themselves everything they need to know. What we establish, however, is that you need a good dose of curiosity and craziness to find your feet in this world, and we discuss the many different pathways you can take to fully equip yourself. Long gone are the days when you needed a degree from a prestigious school - we give you our hit-list of top resources that will go a long way in helping you succeed in this industry. Whether you are someone who prefers learning by  reading, attending Meetups or listening to podcasts, this episode will provide you with lots of new perspectives on learning about distributed systems.
