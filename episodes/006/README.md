## Topic

- What is the concept?
    - First, there were monoliths
    - Stateless workloads don't concern themselves with persisting data. Usually, they delegate this concern to a seperate layer.
    - Stateful workloads persist data.
    - Stateful workloads often require more complex infrastructure considerations. It is harder to treat stateless workloads as "cattle".
- Where did we first hear about it?
- What does it mean to us?
- What came before?
- Relevant parties? Orgs? Companies? Communities? 
- What are modern alternatives?
